Modulation Depths (SSVEP Frequencies):
    0.2044
    0.2439
    0.3578
    0.1438

The modulation depths you've obtained represent a measure of how the amplitude of the SSVEP signal at the specified frequencies (10 Hz, 8.57 Hz, 12 Hz, and 7.5 Hz) varies over time. 

Here's what the results signify:

1. **10 Hz SSVEP**:
   - Modulation Depth: 0.2044
   - This indicates that at 10 Hz, the amplitude of the SSVEP signal exhibits a moderate level of variation over time. A higher modulation depth suggests a stronger and more consistent SSVEP response.

2. **8.57 Hz SSVEP**:
   - Modulation Depth: 0.2439
   - This indicates that at 8.57 Hz, the amplitude of the SSVEP signal exhibits a relatively higher level of variation over time compared to 10 Hz. This suggests a potentially stronger and more consistent SSVEP response at 8.57 Hz.

3. **12 Hz SSVEP**:
   - Modulation Depth: 0.3578
   - This indicates that at 12 Hz, the amplitude of the SSVEP signal exhibits a relatively high level of variation over time. This suggests a potentially strong and consistent SSVEP response at 12 Hz.

4. **7.5 Hz SSVEP**:
   - Modulation Depth: 0.1438
   - This indicates that at 7.5 Hz, the amplitude of the SSVEP signal exhibits a lower level of variation over time compared to the other frequencies. This suggests a potentially weaker or less consistent SSVEP response at 7.5 Hz.

In summary, higher modulation depths indicate a stronger and more consistent SSVEP response at the respective frequencies. This information can be valuable for evaluating the strength of SSVEP responses and understanding the effectiveness of the visual stimuli used in the experiment.
